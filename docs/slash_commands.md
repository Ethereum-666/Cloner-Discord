### Role mention pings (`/role_mention`)

Configure roles that get auto-mentioned at the **top of cloned messages**, per **clone** (cloned server) and optionally per **cloned channel**.

These commands **must be run in the cloned server**, not the original (host) server.

---

#### `/role_mention add <role> [channel_id]`

**Description:** Add a role to be mentioned on cloned messages for this clone.

- `role` — The role in the **cloned guild** to mention.
- `channel_id` — (Optional) **Cloned channel ID** to scope the ping.  
  - Leave empty to apply to **all channels** in this clone.  
  - Set to a specific channel ID to only ping in that cloned channel.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Managed roles (created by integrations/bots) cannot be used and will be rejected.

**Behavior:**

- If `channel_id` is **empty**: the role will be mentioned on **all cloned messages** in this cloned server.
- If `channel_id` is **set**: the role will only be mentioned on cloned messages in that **specific cloned channel**.
- If you try to add a duplicate configuration for the same scope, the bot will tell you it is already configured.

**Examples:**
```text
/role_mention add @Alerts
/role_mention add @RaidPing channel_id:123456789012345678
```

---

#### `/role_mention list`

**Description:** List all role mention configurations for the **current clone**.

For each config, the bot shows:

- A **short config ID** (e.g. `a1b2c3d4`)
- The **role** that will be mentioned
- The **scope**:
  - `all channels`, or
  - a specific **cloned channel** (by mention or ID, if deleted)

These config IDs are used with `/role_mention delete`.

**Example:**
```text
/role_mention list
```

Example output format (embed content):

```text
`a1b2c3d4` • @Alerts — all channels
`e5f6g7h8` • @RaidPing — channel #raids
`z9y8x7w6` • @News — channel `123456789012345678` (deleted)
```

---

#### `/role_mention delete <config_id>`

**Description:** Delete a role mention configuration by its **config ID**.

- `config_id` — The short ID shown in `/role_mention list` (e.g. `a1b2c3d4`).

This removes that specific configuration for the **current clone** only.  
If the ID doesn’t exist for this clone, the bot will respond that it was not found.

**Examples:**
```text
/role_mention delete a1b2c3d4
/role_mention delete e5f6g7h8
```

---

## Channel webhook identity (`/channel_webhook`)

Customize the webhook **name** and **avatar** Copycord uses when cloning messages, either per-channel or for all cloned channels.

### `/channel_webhook set <channel> <webhook_name> [webhook_avatar_url]`
**Description:** Set a custom webhook identity for one cloned channel.

- `channel` — The **cloned** text channel to customize.
- `webhook_name` — Name shown on all cloned messages in this channel.
- `webhook_avatar_url` — (Optional) Image URL used as avatar.

**Examples:**
```text
/channel_webhook set #cloned-chat "Copycord Relay"
/channel_webhook set #cloned-chat "Copycord Relay" webhook_avatar_url:https://example.com/avatar.png
```

---

### `/channel_webhook view <channel>`
**Description:** View the custom webhook profile for a channel.

Shows the current webhook name and avatar (if set) for that cloned channel.

**Example:**
```text
/channel_webhook view #cloned-chat
```

---

### `/channel_webhook clear <channel>`
**Description:** Remove the custom webhook profile from a channel.

After clearing, cloned messages in that channel use the original author’s name and avatar again.

**Example:**
```text
/channel_webhook clear #cloned-chat
```

---

### `/channel_webhook list`
**Description:** List all channels in this clone that have custom webhook profiles.

Shows each channel, its webhook name, and whether a custom avatar is set.

**Example:**
```text
/channel_webhook list
```

---

### `/channel_webhook set_all <webhook_name> <confirm> [webhook_avatar_url] [overwrite_existing]`
**Description:** Apply a webhook name/avatar to **all cloned channels** in this server.

- `webhook_name` — Name used on cloned messages in all cloned channels.
- `confirm` — Must be `confirm` to run.
- `webhook_avatar_url` — (Optional) Avatar URL applied to all channels.
- `overwrite_existing` — If `true`, replaces any existing per-channel profiles.

**Examples:**
```text
/channel_webhook set_all "Copycord Relay" confirm
/channel_webhook set_all "Copycord Relay" confirm webhook_avatar_url:https://example.com/avatar.png overwrite_existing:true
```

---

### `/channel_webhook clear_all <confirm>`
**Description:** Clear **all** channel webhook profiles in this clone.

- `confirm` — Must be `confirm` to proceed.

After running, all cloned messages revert to using the original author’s name and avatar.

**Example:**
```text
/channel_webhook clear_all confirm
```

---

#### `/mapping_debug`

**Description:** Show an ephemeral debug view of the **current clone's guild mapping** for the guild where the command is run.

**Example:**
```text
/mapping_debug
```

---

## Copycord Env (`/env`)

Configure specific environment variables.

#### `/msg_cleanup`

**Description:** Set how many days stored messages are kept in the database before the automatic cleanup task removes them.

**Example:**
```text
/env msg_cleanup days:7
```

---

## Per-mapping word/phrase rewrites (`/rewrite`)

Configure simple **find & replace rules** that modify cloned messages for a specific mapping (source guild → cloned guild).  
These rewrites are applied **after** other sanitization, and affect both message content and most embed text (title, description, fields, etc.).

---

### `/rewrite add <source_text> <replacement_text>`
**Description:** Add or update a word/phrase rewrite for the **current clone mapping** (the guild where you run the command).

- `source_text` — Word or phrase to search for in cloned messages (case-insensitive).
- `replacement_text` — Text that should replace `source_text` in cloned messages.

If a rewrite with the same `source_text` already exists for this mapping, it will be **updated** instead of creating a duplicate.

**Examples:**
```text
/rewrite add source_text:"hello" replacement_text:"yo"
/rewrite add source_text:"team rocket" replacement_text:"team valor"
```

With the above rules configured, a cloned message like:

```text
hello from team rocket
```

would be delivered to the cloned guild as:

```text
yo from team valor
```

---

### `/rewrite list`
**Description:** List all word/phrase rewrites configured for the **current clone mapping**.

Each rewrite is shown with a numeric **ID** and its mapping:

- `[id] source_text → replacement_text`

You can use this ID with `/rewrite remove` to delete a specific rule.

**Example:**
```text
/rewrite list
```

Example output (embed body):
```text
[1] `hello` → `yo`
[2] `team rocket` → `team valor`
```

---

### `/rewrite remove <rewrite_id>`
**Description:** Remove a word/phrase rewrite for the **current clone mapping** using its numeric ID (as shown in `/rewrite list`).

- `rewrite_id` — The ID of the rewrite rule to delete.

If no rewrite exists with that ID for this mapping, Copycord will tell you that nothing was removed.

**Examples:**
```text
/rewrite remove rewrite_id:2
```

After the above, the rule for `team rocket` → `team valor` is removed, but any other rewrite rules remain active.
