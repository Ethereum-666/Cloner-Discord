# Web Dashboard Overview

Copycord's web dashboard is a modern, feature-rich interface for managing all aspects of your server cloning setup. Access it at **http://localhost:8080** (or your configured port).

## Dashboard home

The main dashboard page gives you an at-a-glance view of your entire setup:

- **Bot status** — Connection status and uptime for both the server bot and client bot
- **Guild mappings** — All your source → clone server pairs
- **Quick actions** — Start/stop bots, create new mappings
- **Activity feed** — Recent events and operations

## Navigation

The dashboard sidebar has these pages:

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Configuration** | Bot status, global config, guild mappings, start/stop |
| **Channels** | View and customize cloned channel names, orphan detection, backfill |
| **Guilds** | Browse all servers your self-bot is in, export messages |
| **Forwarding** | Set up message forwarding to Telegram, Pushover, etc. |
| **Scraper** | Member scraper tool for exporting user data |
| **System** | Version info, database backups |
| **Logs** | Event logs  |

## Authentication

If you set a `PASSWORD` environment variable (or configured it in `.env`), you'll need to log in before accessing the dashboard. The session persists via a secure cookie.

To change or remove the password:
- **Docker**: Edit the `PASSWORD` environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Manual**: Edit `PASSWORD` in `code/.env`

## Starting and stopping bots

The dashboard provides a **Start** button for both the server and client bots. Both must be running for cloning to work. Status chips show green "running" or red "stopped" with live uptime tracking.

Valid tokens are required to start.

### Add Bot to Server

Once your bot token is validated, an **Add Bot to Server** button appears next to the Start button. Click it to open Discord's bot authorization page with the correct permissions pre-configured — no need to manually build an invite URL.

## Global configuration

The Global Configuration card lets you set core settings:

- **SERVER_TOKEN** / **CLIENT_TOKEN** — Your Discord bot and account tokens
- **COMMAND_USERS** — User IDs allowed to run slash commands
- **LOG_LEVEL** — `INFO` or `DEBUG`
- **AUTO_START** — Automatically start bots when Copycord launches (requires valid tokens)
- **MAX_LOG_SIZE_MB** — Maximum log file size before old entries are pruned (default: 10 MB, set to 0 to disable)

## Log viewer

Click **View server logs** or **View client logs** on the Bots card to open the log viewer. Features:

- Real-time log streaming
- Search/filter logs
- **Clear logs** button to wipe the selected log file (with confirmation)

## Real-time updates

The dashboard uses WebSocket connections for real-time updates. You'll see live status changes, log streaming, and operation progress without needing to refresh the page.
