### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (recommended) or the manual installer
- A Discord Bot Token + a Discord User Token

### Docker Install

1. Create a folder with this `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  admin:
    image: ghcr.io/copycord/copycord:v3.24.0
    container_name: copycord-admin
    environment:
      - ROLE=admin
      - PASSWORD=copycord # change or comment out to disable login
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

  server:
    image: ghcr.io/copycord/copycord:v3.24.0
    container_name: copycord-server
    environment:
      - ROLE=server
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
